# Budget Tracker

My app is a budget tracker, an app able to keep track of users's budget information. The users will be able to input their income and expenses, the app will then calculate the amount of money available to the user according to the information inputed. The user will be able to budget for one month at a time. Additionally, the user is able to choose a category when inputting an income or expense. The app will use this to output additional information about the user's income and expense habits.
